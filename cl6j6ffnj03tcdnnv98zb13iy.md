## My University Experience


# Introduction üëãüèΩ

So hey, This will be my first ever blog on any platform. 
Hi guys, I am Akash and currently I am a 3rd year Computer Science student in BMS College of Engineering

# My First Year...

So I joined my college in 2019 with a mindset of making a lot of contribution with my learning in the community started searching for some developers society for my accurate and better learning in the domain which I am choosing.
But unfortunately, I didn't find any such society in my college and I am not blaming the college here because the students are much responsible for such of these societies but this college id about 75 years old and still not having a developers society is kinda rough.

So I started of my own and get to the basics of HTML and CSS and since I was new with these techs because I didn't took any Computer Science course in my 11th or 12th.


# My Second Year...

### My 3rd Sem

Now here I started to get some pace on the techs because it took me alot to learn just basic things.
I jumped to Javascript to learn the basic functioning of the websites around.

I gave almost 2 months to get along with JS, then one of my friend told me about JAVA because of the Data Structure and Algorithm, I have to learn a language from (C++ , JAVA ,  Python).
So I chose JAVA because searched about it, and many companies works in Java.

### My 4th Sem

I continued with Java and Javascript side by side.
I also started a small challenge for me in Javascript to make 30 components for websites (like, dropdowns, tabs, color palletes etc)
So each day I make 1 component to test my skills of Javascript and started learning about Data Structures and Algorithm and using Java to practise those.



# My Third Year...

### My 5th Sem

In my third year, I heard of a frame work called REACT. So I started to work on that, and side by side I was show casing my work on Javascript on [LINKEDIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akash-tiwari-03b3621b7/) for more reach and my work.

At that moment I made my first website, My [PORTFOLIO](https://akashtiwari750156.netlify.app) In that I used techs like React, Node, MongoDB, Express (MERN stack).

At the same moment I reached out by 2 projects and I worked on them both (one is using REACT and the other in NEXTjs)

So I started the learning of NextJS, which also a great tool and somewhere similar to the React, so I learned it quite quickly.

And also started to work on my new project named [dailyBlog](https://dailyblog.vercel.app)

And this one I used NextJS, MongoDB, NodeJS, ExpressJS and also cloudinary to store my images.


### My 6th Sem

In my 6th semester, I heard about Devops by @[Kunal Kushwaha](@kunalk) and I got so fascinated with that I started to learn about Devops from that day only.

So I started with the basic of Linux commands, and since I was good the Networking and other subjects in my college, so networking was easily digestible for me but still I saw the lecture of @[Kunal Kushwaha](@kunalk) just in case.

And now I am studying Kubernetes with documentations and Kunal's videos which are helping me alot.

*I also dockerize my dailyBlog web-app with docker

And also automate the dockerization of the app with jenkins*. I am having alot of fun with Devops tools üõ†

# Still in 3rd Year
